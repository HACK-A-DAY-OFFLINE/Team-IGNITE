# Team-IGNITE
We are building KANNAMMA — a voice-first maternal health companion that uses an IVR system and an ASHA dashboard to track pregnant mothers, ensure timely reminders, flag risks early, and reduce last-mile communication gaps in rural India. Simple, reliable, and human-centric.



# Kannamma - Maternal Health Voice Guardian

> "A mother doesn't need an app — she just needs a voice that remembers."

Kannamma is an IVR-based voice guardian system that calls expecting mothers weekly in Tamil/Telugu, reminds them about checkups and tablets, and connects them to ASHA workers when they need help.

## Features

- **IVR Voice Calls** - Automated weekly reminders in Tamil/Telugu
- **ASHA Dashboard** - React-based dashboard for ASHA workers
- **Health Tracking** - Period tracking, PCOS management, post-pregnancy care
- **Appointment Management** - Schedule and track ANC appointments
- **PHC Stock Management** - Track medicine and vaccine inventory
- **Flagged Mothers** - Automatic flagging when help is needed
- **Call Logs** - Complete history of all IVR calls
